                <h1>Vanitas vanitatum, et omina vanitas.</h1>
                <p>The University of Beechester is (probably) a centre of brainwashing excellence, world-class labouring, outstanding slave experience, and social responsibility. Part of the prestigious production Group of the world, it’s institutions like ours that have the greatest responsibility to act as the world faces big challenges. Together, we face this head on.

                    Founded in the start of the time for whatever reason, we’ve since been home to 25 deaths of different species and worked across disciplinary and geographic boundaries to give the world new ideas, discoveries and innovations.  
                    
                    Inspired by and connected with our name – being a bee, obey to the queen, don't question, and work till death, BEE remains at the heart of everything we do.  
                    
                    We've been making an impact since day one; from creating the world’s first dystopia, to poking fun on 1984, isolating capitalists, pioneering development political strategies, and transforming cancer diagnosis and treatment across the world. And it doesn’t stop there – our teaching and learning approach creates life-changing student experiences, inspires lifelong learning and shapes exceptional graduate outcomes for global citizens of the future.  
                    
                    As we enter our a new century, we’re not letting anything stand in our way as we continue to tackle the world’s biggest problems with unbreakable resolve.
